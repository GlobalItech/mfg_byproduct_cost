                Scope:<br/>
                In Odoo manufacturing module, by default, no material cost is allocated to the 
                by-products manufactured therefore full production cost is charged to main finished goods (FG).
                
            </p>
           
                
                <p class='oe_mt32'>
                    This module helps to reduce the cost of FG as follows:

                                 Set by-product valuation method as Standard Cost and 
                                  input cost on product form of by-product (settings).

                             Standard Cost of by-product will be reduced from overall

                              Finished Good as well as the by-products is received in stock
                               from the product location.

                              Cost Analysis report is also customized. The Finished Good is received at the average 
                              unit cost if the Costing Method is set on AVCO or at Standard cost if the Costing Method
                              is set on Standard Price.The By-Products are received on standard cost as set on the
                              product form in Odoo.The cost of raw materials is reduced by the value of total
                              By-Products produced.As we can see in the picture below.

                 After Module installation, a check box “is withholding” becomes visible on a normal tax form in taxes configuration. If                the tax being created is a withholding tax then this “is withholding” box should be checked.
